<p>This is an animation based on 40 years of climate reanalysis data.</p>
<p>The goal here is to fit models to this data and use these models to help provide better forecasts for future natural catastrophes.</p>
<p>In particular, hidden markov models will be fitted to the data to capture correlations in hazards across the globe and with luck  reveal underlying quasi -periodic drivers that modulate the climate.</p>
<p>Karma Pi is a personal project where I explore data visualisation and simulation of all sorts.</p>
<p>From simulating the inners of black holes through the world’s climate and even the FIFA soccer world club common themes emerge.</p>
<p>Nested spheres of data are at the core of much that is here.</p>
<p>There is much to do here, these images for now are just ghostly flickers of models to come.</p>
<p>I should make it possible to see the anomaly relative to some mean – indeed there is code in ncdf that does that.  But time is short.</p>
<p>The larger problem is this is just one variable of many that the ECMWF provides and they are just one such source of this data.</p>
<p>That is another aim of karmapi: how to make the exchange of such data as seamless as the exchange of software.</p>
<p>The world.gif image was created by using the <em>convert</em> to turn the png’s saved by karmapi.ncdf module into a gif.</p>
<p>A late entry, only hearing about the competition a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>And whilst this particular plot does not use matplotlib, there is also a MagicCarpet that does.</p>
<p>Thanks to John Hunter for all the inspiration.</p>
