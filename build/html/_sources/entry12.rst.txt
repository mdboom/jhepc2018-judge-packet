This chart uses the [altair](http://altair-viz.github.io/) visualization library to create an interactive exploration of daily weather in Seattle during the years 2012-2015. The chart links time of year, temperature, precipitation amount, and precipitation type using three types of interactions:

- By hovering over individual points in the top panel, the viewer can see more details about individual points.
- By clicking and dragging on the top panel, the viewer can select a range of dates to focus on.
- By clicking or shift-clicking on the bars in the lower panel, the viewer can focus on points by type of weather.

This type of intuitive interaction with visualizations gives the user a very intuitive way to explore the relationships in complicated datasets. It lets you see, for example, the proportion of sunny and rainy days across different times of the year. This kind of linked interaction is possible to construct very quickly and succinctly using Altair's selection syntax, which is derived from the Vega-Lite visualization grammar upon which Altair is based.
